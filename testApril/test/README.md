# JavaScript Test 

## Complete all questions to the best of your abilities. You can use google, but you cannot ask other students or teachers for help. Also, do not copy code. 

### Create an index.js file and work from there. Please do not forget to comment in the question number above your answers.

1. Write a program to display the city name if the string begins with "Los" or "New" otherwise return "The city name does not begin with Los or New". 

2. Write a program to compute the sum of three elements of a given array of integers. The length of the array must be 3.  
* **Example**
* [5, 10, 15] ➞ 30

3. Given two strings, firstName and lastName, return a single string in the format "last, first".
* **Examples**
* "John", "Doe" ➞ "Doe, John"
* "Mary", "Jane" ➞ "Jane, Mary"

4. Write a program that takes an integer and returns true if it's divisible by 100, otherwise return false.
* **Examples**
* 1 ➞ false
* 1000 ➞ true
* 100 ➞ true

5. Write a program that adds a string ending to each item in an array.
* **Examples & Expected output**
* ["clever", "meek", "hurried", "nice"], "ly" ➞ ["cleverly", "meekly", "hurriedly", "nicely"]
* ["new", "pander", "scoop"], "er" ➞ ["newer", "panderer", "scooper"]
* ["bend", "sharpen", "mean"], "ing" ➞ ["bending", "sharpening", "meaning"]

6. Write a program that checks whether a number is even or odd and returns "even" for even numbers and "odd" for odd numbers.
* **Examples & Expected Output**
* 3 ➞ "3 is odd"
* 146 ➞ "146 is even"
* 19 ➞ "19 is odd"

7. You are given 2 out of 3 angles of a triangle, in degrees e.g. 29° and 59°. Write a program that classifies the missing angle (the third angle of a triangle) as either "acute", "right", or "obtuse" based on its degrees.

* **Notes**
* An acute angle is smaller than 90°.
* A right angle is exactly 90°.
* An obtuse angle is greater than 90°  (but smaller than 180°).
* For example: 11°, 20° should return "obtuse", since the missing angle would be 149°, which makes it obtuse.

* **Examples**
* 27°, 59° ➞ Then the third angle is 92° so it is "obtuse"
* 135°, 11° ➞ The third angle is "acute"
* 45°, 45° ➞ The third angle is a "right angle"

8. Make a variable with the string value of "maria jane jones". Convert each first letter to uppercase. Make sure your code works for any three names e.g. "john james smith". 

9. Write a program that takes a string and returns the word count. The string will be a sentence.
* **Examples Expected output**
* "This is an example" ➞ 4
* "One more example for good measure" ➞ 6
* "JavaScript is fun, right?" ➞ 4

10. Write a program to multiply each value in an array by the number of items in that array.
* **Examples**
* [2, 3, 1, 0] (2 * 4), (3 * 4), (1 * 4), (0 * 4) ➞ [8, 12, 4, 0] 
* [4, 1, 1] ➞ [12, 3, 3]
* [1, 0, 3, 3, 7, 2, 1] ➞  [7, 0, 21, 21, 49, 14, 7]
* [0] ➞ [0]

## Good luck! :)
