### Task 1
Go to your JavaScriptl test, rewrite the answers using functions! 

### Task 2

#### 1. Reverse
Create a function to reverse a number. 

Examples: 
* reverse(34532) -> expected output: 23543

#### 2. Alphabetical Order

Examples:
<<<<<<< HEAD
* alphaOrder("webdev") -> expected output: "bdeevw"

* Note: Assume numbers, symbols and punctuation are not included in the string.  

#### 3. The Greater Numbers

Examples: 
* findGreatest([3, 4, 5], 4) -> expected output: 5
* findGreatest([10, 20, 30], 12) -> expected output: 20, 30
* findGreatest([0, 10, 3], 4) -> expected output: 10

#### 4. Dog Years
Create a function which calculates how old a dog is in doggie years. The function should accept one argument that is the puppy's age. Calculate the dog's age in dog years based on the calculaton of 1 human year = 7 dog years. 

Example
* dogAge(4) -> expected output example: "Your doggo is 28 years old in human years!"

#### 5. A Lifetime Supply...

Examples: 
* calcSupply(25, 2) -> expected output: You will need 40,150 bars of chocolate (2 a day) to last you till the age of 80. 
* calcSupply(40, 3) -> expected output: You will need 43,800 packets of crisps  (3 a day) to last you till the age of 80. 

**Bonus - A lifetime supply**
Accept floating point values for amount per day and round the result. 

#### 6. For the longest word
Create a function to find the longest word in string. 
Examples: 
* longestWord("this is a web development course") ->  expected output: "development"

#### 7. AEIOU: Vowels

Examples: 
* findVowels("this is a string") -> expected output: 4 vowels found

* Notes: vowels are "a, e, i, o u". 

#### 8. Data Types
Create a function that detects the data type of the argument passed. 

Examples: 
* detectType("hello") -> expected output: type of argument is a string. 
* detectType(4) -> expected output: type of argument is a number. 

#### 9. Count Occurrences 
Create a function that accepts two arguments: a string and a letter. The function should count the number of occurrences of that letter in the string. 

Examples: 
* countOccurrences("this is a string", "i") -> expected output: occurrences of i: 3 

#### 10. Counting Letters
Create a function that counts the number of occurrences of each letter in a string. 

Examples: 
* countLetters("tree") -> expected output: t: 1, r: 1, e: 2
