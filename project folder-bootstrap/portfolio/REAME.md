Create your own portfolio website! 

MUST HAVE: 
-Three links to separate pages eg. Home/Experience/Portfolio/Contact
-Responsive Design: Mobile/Tablet/Desktop
-Profile Picture + Personal statement
-Links to your social media pages eg. Github, LinkedIn, Codepen etc which open on new tabs.
-Work Experience AND/OR Projects displayed (eg. country of origin project and portfolio project from orientation course)
-A way for users to contact you either through contact details or through a form

CAN HAVE (OPTIONAL)
-Hero Image 
-Form 
-Carousel
-Image gallery

You can use bootstrap to complete the portfolio, pure CSS or SCSS. Use whichever tools you feel comfortable with or want to practice using! 

You have THREE full days to complete the project so plan out the website well in terms of styling and responsive design. Use the wireframe images in the folder for reference, and to get an idea for your website layout. 

Good luck!
